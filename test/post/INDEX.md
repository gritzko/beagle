# post/ — `be post` (commit) integration cases

* `01-bare-msg/` — put + post on a fresh worktree; smallest possible
  case (one file, one commit).  Does not exercise GET.
* `02-two-children-promote/` — two child branches each grow two commits
  and promote into trunk; first promote ff's, second triggers rebase.
* `03-rebase-on-divergent-parent/` — `be post ?..` from a child whose
  parent advanced; trunk + child cur auto-sync to the rebased tip.
* `04-criss-cross-merge/` — two siblings each `be patch` the other and
  post; a third cross-patch demonstrates dogs sidestepping the classic
  criss-cross via single-parent commits and PATCH provenance erasure.
* `07-patch-multi-author/` — two cherry-picks from a fix branch with
  two authors, then bare `be post`: the resulting commit must inherit
  message + author from the topologically latest patched commit, with
  ` (+N)` and ` (et al)` decorations for the count and author mix.
